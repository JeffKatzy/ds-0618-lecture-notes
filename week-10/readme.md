# Module 3 Projects 

### Regression and classification algorithms 

In module 3, we covered regression and classification.  You should use both in your project.  We will have science fair for this on Tuesday 9/4.  (We will not allocate class time for this on Tuesday).  **For this project use at least three of the classification algorithms and one kind of regression.**

We covered the following classification and regression topics: 

* nearest neighbors 
* support vector machines 
* logistic regression 
* decision trees: random forest, and boosting 

We also covered the following regression: 

* regression
* lasso regression
* ridge regression


### Tuning and evaluating learning models

In working with different machine learning models, use the techniques in class to tune and select learning models.  These techniques include: 

* Train, Validation, and Testing of models
* Bias Variance Tradeoff
* False positive vs False negatives, and trading off between the two 
* Imbalanced Classes
* Feature Selection
* Interpretability of model vs Model Error

### Data Gathering

For this project use a unique dataset.

This means either using multiple APIs or datasets to bring together data from different sources, or create a unique dataset from scraping.

### Bonus 

* Integrate your model in a dash/flask app
