## Module 4 Projects

### Deep Learning

In module 4, we covered unsupervised learning and deep learning. We will have a
science fair in class on Tuesday, September 18th.

Your project can include:

* Dimensionality Reduction
* Clustering
* Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Word2Vec NLP analysis
* Recurrent Neural Networks

#### Data Gathering:
Data can be captured from current databases online or scraped. Some useful sources of data for Deep Learning are:

* http://www.image-net.org/
* http://deeplearning.net/datasets/
* https://skymind.ai/wiki/open-datasets
* https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch


#### Final Product:
* Your final product can either be an analysis (in a jupyter notebook, dashboard, or slideshow) or a web application (with Flask or Dash).
