# Final Project Requirements

We begin final projects September 18 and the science fair for projects will be Thursday October 4.  The goal is to answer an "interesting" question (more on that below), that allows you to review the first three modules (and ideally the fourth).  

### Topic requirements
The projects are in a domain of your choosing.  Your project does not have to answer just one question, but may try to answer multiple questions in a domain, or subsequent questions.  (Now that we know X, what's the next question that comes from this.)  When choosing a topic, try to think through the "So what?" of your question.  

* What are the outcomes you think you will find (use mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive for this), and then so what?
* How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?

Also, plan in advance for feasibility of the question in the time allowed, answering the following:

* What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?
* What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?

### Technical Requirements

Your project must meet the following technical requirements:

A. Module 1
* A unique dataset, either from multiple sources or scraped?
* Use of SQL, Object Relations (at least three models), and ETL
* A web app with Dash (for dashboards), or Flask for recommendation engines

B. Module 2
* Regression analysis, may include:
  * Data transformation (logistic regression, standardization)
  * Regularization
  * Linear and Non linear


C. Module 3

1. Must choose at least three of the topics covered:
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines
  * Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * Time Series
  * Nearest Neighbors

2. Evaluation of machine learning models
  * ROC curves
  * Cross-Validation
  * Confusion Matrices

D. Module 4
  * Principal Component Analysis
  * Deep learning techniques (optional) or clustering
  * Recommendation Engines (optional)

E. Deliverable

The deliverable for this project will be two components:

1. A flask app or Dash application as well as
2. A Jupyter notebook for a presentation (this will end up being the readme on your github)
  * The Jupyter notebook will have two components:
    1. First a case to be made for actions to a non-technical audience
    2. The technical analysis for a data science audience

### Final Project Proposals (2 project ideas)
1. What question/questions are you trying to solve?
  * What are the outcomes you think you will find (could use mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive for this), and then so what?
  * How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?
  * What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?
  * What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?

2. What are some data sources that would allow you to answer this?
  * What is the ideal data you would hope to gather to answer this question?  
  * Potentially missing data, that could cause omitted variable bias?
3. What will be the web component of your final project?
  * Will you create a Flask web app? Dash?
4. How will you use regression and classification?
5. What are the challenges you foresee with this project?
6. What are your next steps moving forward?
